##DOM Bomb

Dombomb is a Chrome plugin that lets you place [font bombs](http://fontbomb.ilex.ca/) across the web.  The bomb goes off when someone else with the plugin hovers over it.

###Installation

1. clone the project somewhere on your computer (`git clone git@github.com:muffs/dombomb.git`)

2. Manage extensions in chrome (in settings go to `tools` -> `Extensions`)

3. check the developer mode checkbox (to install a plugin not from the chrome web store)

4. click "load unpacked extensions" and choose the `chrome-extension` directory within `dombomb`


###Usage

1. Click the bomb logo to activate bomb

2. Click somewhere on the page with the crosshairs to set the bomb

3. Next time someone with the plugin hovers over that spot, it blows up!
